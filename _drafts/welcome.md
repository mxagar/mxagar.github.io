Hi, I'm Mikel Sagardia!

I'm a data scientist and engineer with a passion for all things related to **machine learning**. I have a [PhD](https://elib.dlr.de/132879/) in the intersection between robotics, virtual simulations and human-machine interfaces. However, since 2017 my interests have progressively shifted to applications that combine **computer vision** and **natural language processing**.

This site collects personal musings and references to projects that focus on those topics. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, a researcher, or just someone who is curious about these subjects, I hope you'll find something of interest here.

## More about me

When our second kid was born in 2020, we moved back to [San Sebastian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti√°n) after 14 years in Munich. There, I work remotely for [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com). Previously, I've been at the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8017), [MVTec](https://www.mvtec.com) and [Vicomtech](https://www.vicomtech.org/en).
