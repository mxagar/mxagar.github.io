Hi, I'm Mikel Sagardia!

I'm an engineer located in San Sebasti√°n (Basque Country / Spain).

I have a PhD in the intersection between robotics, virtual simulations and human-machine interfaces. However, in the past years my interest has shifted to

- **machine vision**,
- **machine learning**,
- and **data science**.

Currently, I'm collaborating with a limited number of teams as an external consultant. At the same time, I'm learning and building business ideas.

Previously, I have lived in Munich (Germany) for over 14 years -- bitte gleich auf Deutsch mit mir! There, I worked at the German Aerospace Center (where the KUKA cobot was orginally conceived) and MVTec (where the great Halcon machine vision toolkit is crafted).

You can reach out to me or get more information about me via 

- my email: [sagardia.mikel@gmail.com](mailto:sagardia.mikel@gmail.com)
- my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikel-sagardia/),
- this [website/blog](https://mikelsagardia.io), which features some of my past works,
- and my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DAP30jYAAAAJ).

See you around!

Mikel
